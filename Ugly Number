Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 
For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.

public class Solution {
    public boolean isUgly(int num) {
        if(num<1){
            return false;
        }
        if(num==1){
            return true;
        }
        int n = num;
        while(n%2==0){
            n = n/2;
        }
        while(n%3==0){
            n = n/3;
        }
        while(n%5==0){
            n = n/5;
        }
        return n==1?true:false;
    }
}
